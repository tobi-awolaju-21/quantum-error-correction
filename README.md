# quantum-error-correction
This repo has projects demonstrating quantum error correction techniques using Qiskit and other frameworks. Each project has its own directory, code, and documentation to showcase my quantum software development skills and provide a reference for others. Explore to discover the potential of quantum computing for error correction.
